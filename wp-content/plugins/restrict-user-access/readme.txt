Create Access Levels for your users to conditionally restrict content and manage capabilities. Lightweight and powerful.

== Description ==

Restrict content and contexts to control what your users get exclusive access to - and when. Create an unlimited number of Access Levels and override user and role capabilities without the need of code.

Use this plugin to quickly set up a membership site where your users can get different levels such as Gold, Silver and Bronze. Then, restrict access to e.g. posts tagged "Premium", articles written by specific authors, or all your free products.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration 
1. Activate the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration
1. Have fun creating your first Access Level under the menu *User Access > Access Levels > Add New*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I restrict some content? =

1. Go to User Access > Access Levels > Add New
1. Select a type of content from the "Select content type" dropdown to add a condition group
1. Click on the input field next to the new content type and select the content you want to restrict. This content will be available for users with this Access Level (or higher) only. Remember to save changes on each condition group
1. To the right you can choose to synchronize the Access Level with a User Role. This means that all users with that Role will automatically get this Level. If you choose not to synchronize, you can add the Level to each user individually under the Members tab or their profile
1. For unauthorized users you can choose whether to redirect to another page or to show the content from another page along with a teaser/excerpt from the restricted content
1. Give your new Access Level a descriptive title and save it
1. **Optional** If you want to restrict a context, e.g. "All Posts with Category X", simply select a new type of content from the dropdown in the condition group and repeat Step 3
1. **Optional** You can choose to negate conditions, meaning that if you negate the group "All posts with Category X", you will restrict all content but that

= How do I make an Access Level extend/inherit another level? =

Let us say you have two Access Levels, Gold and Silver. You want your users with the Gold level to be able to see content for the Silver level too.

1. Go to User Access > Access Levels > Edit the Gold level
1. To the right on this screen there is a Extend setting
1. Choose the Silver level as Extend and click Update

Your Gold level now inherits all the conditions from your Silver level. You can create as many hierarchical levels as you want, e.g. Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum.

= I added a Level to a user, but it can still see other content? =

When you create an Access Level to restrict some content, only users with this level will be able to see that content, but they will also be able to see all other (unrestricted) content on your site.

A quick way to "lock down" and make sure e.g. only Administrators can see all content is to create a new Access Level for Administrators with a negated condition group containing "404 Page". This means that normal users only can see the 404 Page.

By default, Administrators will have access to all content regardless of your levels.

= Restricted content is still being displayed on archive pages or in widgets? =

Restrict User Access does currently not support hiding single items from archive pages, search results, widgets or custom lists.

It is recommended only to show titles and excerpts in these cases.
